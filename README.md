This repository contains a collection of Python projects and assignments completed during my first semester in Software Engineering at the University of Ottawa. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including solving quadratic equations, generating math quizzes, drawing basketball square, single player rummy game with dice, social network friend recommandation, dictionaries, sets, objects, and recurrsion. Additionally, some projects focus on recursion, data manipulation, and algorithmic problem-solving. The repository showcases my growth in programming, problem-solving, and applying Python to practical tasks. Each project is well-documented and demonstrates the skills I've developed in areas such as debugging, algorithm design, and web development. Feel free to explore the code, and if you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out.
